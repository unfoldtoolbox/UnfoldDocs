Remember that a linear model is  y = X * b , which allows (after  b  was estimated) to input a so-called  contrast  vector for X. You might know this in the form of  [1, 0, -1, 1]  or similar form. However, for larger models, this method can be prone to errors. The  effects  function is a convenient way to specify contrast vectors by providing the actual levels of the experimental design. It can be used to calculate all possible combinations of multiple variables. If a predictor-variable is not specified here, the function will automatically set it to its typical value. This value is usually the  mean , but for categorical variables, it could be something else.

So there are some things you need to give special attention: @formula : we havent found a way to call macros yet, even though we think it should be possible. For now please use  f = jl.seval(\"@formula(0~1+my+cool+design)\") . Later versions might support something like  f = @formula(\"0~1+my+cool+design)\"  directly Specifying the design : Since Unfold 0.7 we officially switched to the [\"eventtypeA\"=>(formula,basisfunction),\n\"eventtypeB\"=>(otherformula,otherbasisfunction)] Array-based syntax, from a Dict-based syntax. Unfortunately,  =>  (a pair) is not supported in Python and one needs to do some rewriting: jl.convert(jl.Pair,(formula,basisfunction)) which makes the code less readable. We are thinking of ways to remedy this - but right now there is now way around. For now, it is also possible to use the old syntax e.g. in python {\"eventtypeA\"=>(formula,basisfunction),\"eventtypeB\"=>(otherformula,otherbasisfunction)} which is clearly easier to read :) UnfoldSim.design : we need a  Dict  with a  Symbol  , one has to do something like  condition_dict_jl = {convert(jl.Symbol,\"condA\"):[\"car\", \"face\"]}  to do so. We will [try to allow strings}(https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldSim.jl/issues/96) here as well, removing this constraint. When preprocessing your raw data through MNE Python, take the following into consideration: The  Raw object  contains the  first_samp  attribute which is an integer representing the number of time samples that passed between the onset of the hardware acquisition system and the time when data recording started. The Raw data doesn't include these time samples, meaning that the first sample is the beginning of the data aquisition. From the Raw object you can obtain an events array from the annotations through  mne.events from annotations() . The events array, however, does include first samp, meaning that the annotated events in events array don't match the Raw object anymore. Alternatively, it might be easier to convert the annotations to a pandas dataframe directly (`to data frame()`), or even better, load the \"* events.tsv\" from a BIDS dataset. In the latter case, all columns will be preserved, which MNE's read_annotation drops.

This also suggests to use event windows with different sizes between events (as is possible with Unfold). Further, as can be seen below, when choosing longer time-windows the overfit is only of moderate size, thus we additionally recommend to generally err on the longer side, to not miss any important activity.

In case of hierarchical structures (e.g. repeated trials in subjects, different stimuli used) the Linear Mixed Model has become very popular. Unfortunately, fitting such models can be quite involved, especially for EEG data which require massive-modelfitting for each sensor and channel. MixedModels.jl provides a fast way for fitting, and UnfoldMixedModels.jl provides the bookkeeping to do so in a massive way.

Depending on the design, on the components and on     return_epoched , the output can be a 1-D, 2-D, 3-D or 4-D Array.    For example, a 4-D Array would have the dimensions  channels x time x trials x subjects . events : Generated events data frame with latencies.

This will always return the same results and the user is strongly encouraged to provide their own random generator! Notes Some remarks on how the noise is added: If  return_epoched = true  and  onset = NoOnset()  the noise is added to the epoched data matrix. If  onset  is not  NoOnset , a continuous signal is created and the noise is added to this    i.e. this means that the noise won't be the same as in the  onset = NoOnset()  case even if  return_epoched = true . The case  return_epoched = false  and  onset = NoOnset()  is not possible and therefore    covered by an assert statement. Additional remarks on the overlap of adjacent signals when  return_epoched = true : If  onset = NoOnset()  there will not be any overlapping signals in the data because the onset calculation and conversion to a continuous signal is skipped. If an inter-onset distance distribution is given, a continuous signal(potentially with overlap) is constructed and partitioned into epochs afterwards. source"},{"id":360,"pagetitle":"API / Docstrings","title":"UnfoldSim.simulate_and_add!","ref":"/UnfoldDocs/UnfoldSim.jl/stable/api/#UnfoldSim.simulate_and_add!-Tuple{AbstractMatrix, Any, Any, Any}","content":" UnfoldSim.simulate_and_add!  —  Method simulate_and_add!(epoch_data::AbstractMatrix, c, simulation, rng)\nsimulate_and_add!(epoch_data::AbstractArray, c, simulation, rng) Helper function to call  simulate_component  and add it to a provided Array  epoch_data . source"},{"id":361,"pagetitle":"API / Docstrings","title":"UnfoldSim.simulate_component","ref":"/UnfoldDocs/UnfoldSim.jl/stable/api/#UnfoldSim.simulate_component-Tuple{Any, AbstractComponent, Simulation}","content":" UnfoldSim.simulate_component  —  Method simulate_component(rng, c::AbstractComponent, simulation::Simulation) By default call  simulate_component  with  (rng, c::Abstractcomponent, design::AbstractDesign)  instead of the whole simulation.

Notes MixedModels/Sim does not allow simulation of data without white noise of the residuals. Because we want our own noise, we use the following trick to remove the MixedModels-Noise: Practically, we upscale the specified  σs  by factor 10 000, and request a white-noise-level of  σ = 0.0001 . Internally in MixedModels/Sim,  σs  are relative to  σ , and thus are normalized correctly, while keeping the noise 10 000 times smaller than the random effects We cannot exclude that this trick runs into strange numerical issues if the random effect  σs  are very large compared to the fixed effects. Currently, it is not possible to use a different basis for fixed and random effects. If this is needed, some code-scaffold is available but commented out at the moment and requires a bit of implementation work.

The waveform of an ERP usually consists of multiple ERP components which denote the peaks and troughs of the waveform. ERP components are characterized (and named) by their timing relative to the event, their polarity (positive or negative) and their scalp topography. For example, the N170 describes a negative deflection which occurrs roughly 170 ms after the onset of (certain) visual stimuli. Often, researchers are interested how a component (e.g. its amplitude or timing) changes depending on certain experimental factors. For example, N170 has been shown to be related to face processing and its amplitude is modulated by whether the stimulus is a face or an object e.g. a car.
