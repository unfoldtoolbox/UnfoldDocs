# Contribution guide
Contributions are very welcome. These could be typos, bug reports, feature requests, speed optimization, better code, and better documentation.
You are very welcome to raise issues and start pull requests.

## Github issues
We always appreciate people raising issues to improve our packages. If you find any such issue, please refrain from writing us directly and instead raise them on Github with a suitable tag in the respective package repository.

### Bug reports
If you notice any bugs, such as crashing code, incorrect results or speed issues, please raise a GitHub issue with a "bug" tag. The issue should contain a short description of the problem, (optimally) a minimal working example to reproduce the bug and which UnfoldXYZ.jl version you are using.

### Feature requests
If you find that any feature that you'd like to see in a given package is missing, you can raise an issue with the "enhancement" tag. We are always open to new suggestions and try to accomodate your ideas in a timely manner (where possible). Your feature request should ideally contain not only "what" you want, but also "why" you want it. And if you already have a solution to your problem, we would be grateful if you could post that as well. ;)

### Documentation
If you notice anything within our Documentation, please use the "documentation" tag. These issues can contain anything from something not working/ not being displayed correctly, to a concept/ tutorial that is missing or currently hard to understand. We always try to make our documentation more accessible.

## Code contributions (Pull requests)
When opening a pull request, please add a short but meaningful description of the changes/features you implemented. Moreover, please add tests (where appropriate) to ensure that your code is working as expected.

Please have a look at the [developer documentation](developer.md) to learn more about the development workflow, formatting, testing and documentation.
