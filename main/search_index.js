That is, the application of multiple regression models to time series data. While all packages have a focus on EEG data, they can typically be easily applied to pupil dilation, skin conductance, or even fMRI data.\n\n<head>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ntd {\n    text-align: right !important;\n    vertical-align: inherit !important;\n}\n</style></head>\n\n<div>\n<table style=\"margin: 0px auto;\">\n<thead>\n\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Analysis of regression ERPs </td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/Unfold.jl/tree/main\"><picture>\n <source\nsrcset=\"assets/300w/logo_Unfold.jl-dark.png\",alt=\"Unfold.jl Logo dark\"\n   media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"\n   />\n  <img\n src=\"assets/300w/logo_Unfold.jl.png\"\"\n   alt=\"Unfold.jl Logo bright\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"          \n />\n</picture></a></td></tr> \n<tr><td>Mass Univariate Linear Mixed Models</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldMixedModels.jl\"><picture>\n <source\nsrcset=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldMixedModels.jl-dark.png\",alt=\"UnfoldMixedModels.jl Logo dark\"\n   media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"\n   />\n  <img\n src=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldMixedModels.jl.png\"\"\n   alt=\"Unfold.jl Logo bright\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"          \n />\n</picture></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Visualization of ERP/EEG data and Unfold models</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldMakie.jl\"><picture>\n <source\nsrcset=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldMakie.jl-dark.png\",alt=\"UnfoldMakie.jl Logo dark\"\n   media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"\n   />\n  <img\n src=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldMakie.jl.png\"\"\n   alt=\"UnfoldMakie.jl Logo bright\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"          \n />\n</picture></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Simulation of event-based EEG</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldSim.jl\"><picture>\n <source\nsrcset=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldSim.jl-dark.png\",alt=\"UnfoldSim.jl Logo dark\"\n   media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"\n   />\n  <img\n src=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldSim.jl.png\"\"\n   alt=\"UnfoldSim.jl Logo bright\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"          \n />\n</picture></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>BIDS-pipeline support for Unfold.jl</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldBIDS.jl\"><picture>\n <source\nsrcset=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldBIDS.jl-dark.png\",alt=\"UnfoldBIDS.jl Logo dark\"\n   media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"\n   />\n  <img\n src=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldBIDS.jl.png\"\"\n   alt=\"UnfoldBIDS.jl Logo bright\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"          \n />\n</picture></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Decoding with overlap/covariate correction</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldDecode.jl\"><picture>\n <source\nsrcset=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldDecode.jl-dark.png\",alt=\"UnfoldDecode.jl Logo dark\"\n   media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"\n   />\n  <img\n src=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldDecode.jl.png\"\"\n   alt=\"UnfoldDecode.jl Logo bright\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"          \n />\n</picture></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Statistics for Unfold models</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldStats.jl\"><picture>\n <source\nsrcset=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldStats.jl-dark.png\",alt=\"UnfoldStats.jl Logo dark\"\n   media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"\n   />\n  <img\n src=\"assets/300w/logo_UnfoldStats.jl.png\"\"\n   alt=\"UnfoldStats.jl Logo bright\"\n   class=\"h-[45vh] object-cover\"          \n />\n</picture></a></td></tr>\n\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n</div>\n\n\n\ntipp: Tipp\nThe different packages can often be used independently from each other.
